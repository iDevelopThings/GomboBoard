# GomboBoard

A simple suggestion board using Svelte frontend and [Envuso](http://github.com/envuso) backend

Users can register, and view their created boards or others(via link)

They can then create suggestions for your product(for example) and they can be voted on(up/down vote).

Some things are possibly done wrong and hard-coded.

Some things used:

- MongoDB database
- SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS
- JWT Auth
